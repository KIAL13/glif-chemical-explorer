## Introduction

The **Glif Chemical Explorer** provides a platform for educators, students, and anyone interested in chemistry to explore elements in a new way. With features like LLM-driven text generation, JSON processing, and dynamic canvas rendering, users can interact with chemical data like never before. 

This project aims to simplify the learning process and make science education more accessible. 

## Features

- **AI-Powered Text Generation**: Leverage the power of large language models (LLMs) to generate informative text about chemical elements.
  
- **Dynamic Canvas Rendering**: Visualize chemical data in real-time with an interactive canvas that allows users to manipulate and explore elements.
  
- **JSON Processing**: Work with JSON data to easily access and modify chemical information.
  
- **No-Code Interface**: Designed for users without coding experience, making it easy for anyone to use.
  
- **Prompt Engineering**: Tailor your queries to get the most relevant information about chemical elements.

- **Educational Focus**: Supports teachers and students with interactive learning tools.
